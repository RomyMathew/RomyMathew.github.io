<p>This Nationally Recognised and WorkSafe Victoria Accredited Unit allows you to perform work that requires a forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence. Carefully consider lifting a brand new truck, as this can cause premature wear and added stress to critical components such as shocks, wheel bearings, suspension bushings, ball joints, and tie rods. When your load is sitting on pallets, the forklift prongs can fit easily into the pallet to move and carry your heavy load rapidly.</p>
<p>Beyond that, many workers can also be injured when (1) lift trucks are inadvertently driven off loading docks; (2) lifts fall between docks and an unsecured trailer; (3) they are struck by a lift truck; or (4) they fall while on elevated pallets and tines. While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>
