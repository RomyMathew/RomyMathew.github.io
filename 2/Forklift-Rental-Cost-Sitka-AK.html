<p>This course is designed to provide experienced operators with relevant knowledge and understanding of practical use of the Industrial Counterbalance Forklift. Gas forklifts constantly need to be refilled, so the recurring need to purchase fuel makes the long-term costs hefty. If you are a forklift operator, be sure to fasten your seat belt before moving the equipment. They're the most common type of cargo transport truck in stores, but they're also popular in warehouses and distribution centers, too. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical or at full rearward till, whichever is less stable.</p>

A person performing this work is required to hold an order picking forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence. Your 4Ã—4 truck can be your ticket to off-road adventures, your daily driver around town, your hauling and towing machine, or your work truck.</p>
