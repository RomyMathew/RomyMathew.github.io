<p>The operator hand transfers the load onto the pallet one article at a time. Powered pallet trucks operate to a very similar principle as hand-pallet trucks. We have grown from a primarily used forklift warehouse to a fully functioning forklift dealership. This is the leading cause of death involving lift trucks. When a traditional forklift isn't necessary but lifting product above a second-tier rack is, the Toyota Industrial Stacker is a cost-efficient, easy-to-use solution.</p>
