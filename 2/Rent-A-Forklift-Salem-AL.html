<p>If you want as much ground clearance as possible and a bold lifted look, equipping your truck with both a suspension lift kit and a body lift kit is a great option. By decreasing the air pressure, the driver can decrease the weight-carrying capacity of the axle or eliminate it completely by raising it up and off of the road. Our used lifted trucks are durable, capable, and ready to handle any of the local trails and provide you the added power in any driving situation.</p>
<p>To be fair, lifted trucks are not for everyone, however, and there are some drawbacks that go along with their advantages.

Designed to work in narrow aisles, the electric reach stacker can tilt both forwards and backwards for safer load handling.</p>
