<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame. I'm talking about the unGodly big, oversized tires, mudflaps, etc type of trucks that look completely and utterly ridiculous.

Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>

Drivers will also appreciate the better view of the roads in Brownwood, which comes in handy in avoiding obstacles during off-roading journeys. Trucks may be of the reaching or non-reaching type, equipped with tilting mast, or forks that tilt alone without tilting mast, or without any form of mast or fork tilt.</p>
<p>These types of powered industrial trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and have pneumatic (air filled) tires. Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
