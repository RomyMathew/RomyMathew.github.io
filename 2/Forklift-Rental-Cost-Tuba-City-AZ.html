The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load. Popular brands of standup forklifts include Yale, Crown, Baker, Hyster, and Raymond, which range in price from as little as $5,000 used to as much as $35,000 for a fully equipped new machine. Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point.</p>
<p>Featuring a hydraulic jack that is manually operated from the handle, the manual pallet jack gets it name from the manual pump input to raise the fork. Thanks to their high capacity of up to three tons and excellent manoeuvrability in even the tightest of spaces, hand pallet trucks represent ideal warehouse aids. They may be a bit worn out, so when the lift is installed, the proposed 2 inch leaves may only have lifted the truck 1.5 inches.</p>

Pallet jacks from Grainger provide leverage to help you lift heavy pallets full of inventory or materials in the warehouse, on the loading dock or at the jobsite.

<p>Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in. Sometimes the outriggers on a standard walkie reach truck can get in the way of picking loads up. To get around this issue, the counterbalanced stacker has a longer chassis to increase leverage. Forklifts are responsible for only 1% of all warehouse or factory accidents. Our experienced service technicians are ready and able to repair all makes and models of forklifts.</p>
