There are many types of powered industrial trucks.</p>
<p>They can weather any environment and derive fuel from multiple sources, but they do not have the unique capacities that reach forklifts do.

This training is for workers who operate an industrial lift truck (classes 1, 4 or 5) in the workplace, commonly known as counterbalance forklift”.</p>
<p>The M-series reach trucks have a narrow chassis design and 360° steering, this makes them ideal for material operations like block stacking, drive-in racking and other confined areas. A typical telescoping-boom rough terrain forklift is long and low with a pair of wheels at the extreme front and another pair located towards the rear. Actually, this pallet jack operates simi-electronically, and it works best for transporting and lifting tasks.</p>
