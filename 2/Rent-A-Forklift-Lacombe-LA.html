These advanced electric forklifts are equipped with the newest generation of AC technology, assuring you industry-leading performance.

In other words if you are unloading pallets from racking and your top beam is at 144‚Äù you will need a lift truck that has a maximum fork height of a few inches higher to ensure you will be able to lift pallet above the rack and then remove the pallet from the racks.</p>
<p>Sometimes using a forklift for your pallet moving operation is like taking a bazooka to a knife fight. Increasing demand for forklifts across various industry verticals, such as food & beverage, e-commerce, general merchandise, and retail, will propel market size. Patel material handling equipment uses single piece bent forks for extra strength. Celebrating 38 years of success by delivering material handling equipments in India and abroad.</p>
<p>Without a counterbalance license and counterbalance forklift license training, your employees aren't able to operate forklifts.

A walkie stacker forklift is designed for the operator to walk behind the truck and steer it through an attached handle.</p>

The W-series also includes five other versatile pallet trucks with a load capacity up to 2.5 tonnes, making them suitable for all manner of material handling, including horizontal transportation and order picking.</p>
