<h2>Hand Pallet Jack Newburgh</h2>
<p>It's called a counterbalance forklift because the load that's being carried in the front is counterbalanced by a heavy weight mounted on the back of the vehicle. Sit-down Forklift and Rider Pallet Jack experience is helpful. Workplace type and conditions are also factors in hazards commonly associated with powered industrial trucks. Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>

<p>Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in. Sometimes the outriggers on a standard walkie reach truck can get in the way of picking loads up.

Our experienced service technicians are ready and able to repair all makes and models of forklifts.</p>
<p>Lifted trucks also present a danger to those driving in them. The fuel-efficient cushion tire forklifts from Cat, with lift capacities from 3,000 to 15,500 lbs., are ideal for use in indoor applications with smooth, dry floors, where moving palletized loads to and from a loading dock or storage area is required. Counterbalance forklifts are a straightforward appliance that feature dual forks for heavy loads and bulky items.</p>
