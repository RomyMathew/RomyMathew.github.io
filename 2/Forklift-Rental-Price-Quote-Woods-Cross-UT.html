<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>
<p>Dillon Toyota Lift has everything from lift trucks, rough terrain forklifts, sweepers, scrubbers, and more. Due to its sideways operation, side load forklifts can easily drive up alongside racks and load and unload without having to turn. Better ground clearance than cushion tire forklift, softer ride, but larger chassis.
