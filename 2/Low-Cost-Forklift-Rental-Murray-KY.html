A 2000kg load can be sufficiently moved with some effort; however, with poor ground, a poor quality pallet jack, unstable loads, slopes, etc., it will be much more difficult for the pallet jack worker.</p>

<p>If your service crew is already busy with the rest of your equipment, don't load them up with even more equipment to maintain.

Ensure loads are stacked evenly on the forks before moving the pallet jack.</p>
<p>If you need a forklift ASAP, renting may be for the way to go, as you can eliminate the hassle of third-party financing or credit requirements.
