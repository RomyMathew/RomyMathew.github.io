<p>Hiring a forklift means that you won't have to rent or buy a permanent forklift and can merely acquire one for the busy period in order to pick up the slack. Most businesses are cyclical in nature, so renting extra trucks will help a business through the surges of seasonal business. A reach is designed with two unique operator platforms.

<p>The second type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit. The average pallet jack can lift about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg).
