It is also backed with priority support from our nationwide team of field service forklift technicians.

This type of forklift is suited for uneven surfaces with its sturdy pneumatic tires. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
<p>Add on a 6-inch lift kit and 35-inch tires on 20-inch wheels, and it's simply massive. Backed with a team of professional and experts of the industry, we are involved in offering Roll Pallet Truck. We also rent out electric forklift batteries and battery chargers to eliminate your forklift downtime.
