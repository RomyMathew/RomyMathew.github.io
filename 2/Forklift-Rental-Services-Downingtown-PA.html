Gas forklifts constantly need to be refilled, so the recurring need to purchase fuel makes the long-term costs hefty.

In the 1940s, forklifts became even easier to use, thanks to batteries that drivers could recharge. Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>
