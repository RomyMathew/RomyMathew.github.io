<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers.

However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
