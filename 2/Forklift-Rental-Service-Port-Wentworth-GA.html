<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet. Cherry Pickers are found in warehouse environments where they prepare orders for shipment using the cherry picker machine.</p>
<p>With that much juice, the 2C5000 can lift a full payload at 125 ft per minute while an empty payload reaches 130 fpm. The best thing about rough terrain forklifts is that they allow you to work in places traditional forklifts can't go.
