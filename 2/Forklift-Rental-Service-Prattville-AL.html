<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. An overloaded pallet jack is likely to break down and can pose a serious safety hazard for its operators. The Rough Terrain Pallet Truck comes with Extended Raised Height compared to standard pallet trucks. With the largest window of any stockpicker, the Crown SP Series makes operators clearly more productive. We are offering Godrej 2.5 Ton Hand Pallet Truck to our clients.</p>

We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

<p>In the case of forklifts, safe practices must be practised such as having an overhead guard that protects the operator from the accidental falling of objects which could happen whilst loading the forklift.
