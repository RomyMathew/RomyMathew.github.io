You need to check out Kutztown Auto's inventory of New & Pre-Owned Lifted Truck Inventory near Reading, PA. Rough terrain forklifts have achieved a broad level of adoption due to the mobility of the machines themselves. Battery-operated reach trucks are gaining popularity among end use industries, owing to their ability to handle double pallet and horizontal transport.</p>

<p>Our dealers carry all major brands of forklifts to include Yale, Hyster, Crown, TCM, Raymond, Daewoo, CAT, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Clark, Toyota, Linde and Barrett. Linde has developed special design features that simplify the process of picking for every height - from the layout of the control platform and control panels, to the fold-out cab railings. The BT Levio W-series of powered pallet trucks consists of six truck models, including the compact LWE130 for more light-duty applications.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these rough terrain forklifts double as workhorses in the bush here in Australia.
