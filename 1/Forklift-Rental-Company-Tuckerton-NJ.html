<p>Numerous product options, which provide the necessary load capacity and lifting heights, are also available within the reach truck series. Even if you are just going to operate a forklift one time for a specific job, OSHA requires that in addition to a license, you need to be certified to use a forklift and you also need authorization from your employer. If your company utilizes a very narrow aisle operation this classification of lift trucks is for you.</p>
<p>Vertical masted rough terrain forklifts - If you're looking for a forklift that can be driven on uneven, muddy, or rough surfaces, this is the truck you need. Because of an intelligent man-machine interface, these versatile trucks offer enhanced visibility, acceleration and lift control, all of which are simple to programme. The Herc Rental fleet is worth more than $3 billion.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
