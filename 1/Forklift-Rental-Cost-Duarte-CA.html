<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable.

<p>The Teletruk offers typical savings of up to 30% on operating costs compared to a masted forklift truck. No matter what size or capacity you need, you can find a rough terrain forklift for the job. Models through 16,000 pounds lift capacity use a standard 100-horsepower engine; the next two larger models use a 142-horsepower engine; and the largest model, the LK30P44, has a 225-horsepower engine.</p>

Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>
