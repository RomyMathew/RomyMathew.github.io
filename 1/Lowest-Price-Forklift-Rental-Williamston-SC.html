<p>A standard warehouse forklift measures between four and seven feet wide and eight to ten feet long. We're the best place to compare second-hand forklifts from the likes of Mitsubishi, Linde, Kamatsu, Nissan and Caterpillar - names that are trusted by companies operating across the world. Both of these stackers have the ability to lift to heights commonly found on forklifts.</p>
<p>These rough terrain forklifts come with a higher ground clearance that is crucial to work on cross-country terrain. A forklift that is overloaded while lifting a load at height can very easily tip over forwards, with potential of causing serious damage to property, equipment, and people. But work can go a lot quicker if you have the right equipment to help you outâ€”and pallet jack is one of the most convenient and efficient types of equipment out there for the job.</p>
