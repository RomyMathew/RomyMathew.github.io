<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Used for handling large amount of materials, this product is designed with a high level of precision at par with international quality parameters. Whatever materials handling task you need fulfilling, Cat Lift Trucks offer you one of the most dependable and complete counterbalance forklifts in the industry. The most notable feature of the rough terrain forklift is the oversized, aggressive treaded tires.</p>
<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
