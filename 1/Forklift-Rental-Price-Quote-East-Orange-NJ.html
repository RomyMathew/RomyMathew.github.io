<p>If you do most of your work indoors it is unlikely that you'll ever need one, but rough terrain forklifts are a must for outdoor applications and construction sites. Note: Service calls are not officially logged until you hear back from an Eastern Lift Truck Co. employee. It is suggested that powered industrial trucks be painted a color which will comply with the USA Standard Safety Color Code for Marking Physical Hazards and the Identification of Certain Equipment, Z53.1-1967.</p>
<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>In addition to forklifts, we rent forklift attachments, aerial lifts, pallet jacks, sweeper scrubbers, and utility vehicles. In a factory setting, the electric forklift can operate all day on a single charge. 2. 2 Disclaimer This presentation is intended as a resource for providing training on OSHA's revised powered industrial truck operator standards.

Many of the most serious forklift accidents happen when a driver drops a payload.</p>
