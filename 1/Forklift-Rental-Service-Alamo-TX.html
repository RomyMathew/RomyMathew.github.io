These trucks are very efficient in transporting heavy to very heavy materials from one place to another. Our rentals have the flexibility for daily, weekly or monthly rentals and allow you flexibility in your material handling needs.</p>

What's unique about this type of forklift is that the mast can turn left or right independent of the body of the truck.</p>

Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
