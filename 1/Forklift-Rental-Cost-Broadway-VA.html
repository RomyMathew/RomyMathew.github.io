<p>For trucks designated Type EX the class and group of hazardous locations in which they are intended to be used shall be shown. We have uniquely positioned ourselves as a topmost enterprise, engaged in offering a precision-engineered range of Hydraulic Pallet Hand Trucks. Most standard forklifts reach heights between 10 to 15 feet, but some can lift as high as 36 feet.</p>
<p>These rough terrain forklifts come with a higher ground clearance that is crucial to work on cross-country terrain. A forklift that is overloaded while lifting a load at height can very easily tip over forwards, with potential of causing serious damage to property, equipment, and people. But work can go a lot quicker if you have the right equipment to help you out—and pallet jack is one of the most convenient and efficient types of equipment out there for the job.</p>
