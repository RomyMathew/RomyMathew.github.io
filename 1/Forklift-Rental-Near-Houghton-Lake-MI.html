<p>Here's a quick look at a few common hazards associated with forklifts. Often a large forklift load obstructs the driver's view in one direction.

<p>By raising the truck's chassis, more room is provided for large size tires and wheels. Long Term Forklift Rental enables you to work with a minimal amount of equipment reducing the need for spare or surplus equipment. Rental provides the means to obtain the latest technology improving operator satisfaction, WH&S and overall efficiencies. For a more controlled ride that keeps your tires touching the ground beneath you for continuous contact, you need Jeep shocks to replace your old, worn out ones and put you back in control in the driver's seat.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
