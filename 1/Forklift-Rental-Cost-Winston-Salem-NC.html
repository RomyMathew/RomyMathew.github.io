<p>Specifically engineered for the unique challenges of a narrow-aisle warehouse environment, the Crown RR 5700 features the industry's first traction control system, enhanced execution of load-handling functions, and the fastest lift and travel speeds among other available reach trucks. The aim of this course is to provide delegates with the knowledge and practical skills needed to safely operate an Industrial Masted Lift Truck. Whether a forklift will safely carry a load or will tip forward can be determined by comparing the moment (a tendency to produce motion) of both the load and the forklift. Our rental fleet stands ready to supply you with immediate equipment when a need arises.</p>

In order to prevent the lift from tipping, the combined center of gravity of the load and the lift must stay inside the stability triangle (at ground level) at all times.</p>
<p>Gap guards are used to fill in this area and make these lifted trucks look better. Our reach truck training courses are ideal as conversion training for operators already experienced and skilled in using typical counterbalance fork lifts, with a range of the essential skills and knowledge crossing over between the two. An unimpeded view of loads and the surrounding area are a fundamental requirement for safe truck operation.</p>
